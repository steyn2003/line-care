# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test file
php artisan test --filter=MachineTest

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

**Test Coverage**: 67 feature tests covering all critical paths
- Machine management (8 tests)
- Work orders (9 tests)
- Preventive tasks (9 tests)
- Multi-tenancy (12 tests)
- Authorization (29 tests)

See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for detailed testing documentation.

---

## 🔐 Security

### Multi-Tenancy
- Every company's data is completely isolated
- Users can only access their own company's data
- Enforced at database query level

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Operator** - Report breakdowns only
- **Technician** - Manage work orders
- **Manager** - Full system access

### Security Features
- CSRF protection
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session-based authentication
- Input validation & sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (Eloquent ORM)

See [SECURITY_TESTING.md](SECURITY_TESTING.md) for security testing procedures.

## 📊 Database Schema

```
companies
├── users (operators, technicians, managers)
├── locations (production floors, warehouses)
├── machines (equipment inventory)
├── cause_categories (breakdown causes)
├── work_orders (breakdowns & maintenance tasks)
│   └── maintenance_logs (work done records)
└── preventive_tasks (scheduled maintenance)
    └── work_orders (auto-generated)
```

---

## 🔄 Preventive Maintenance Automation

The system automatically generates work orders for preventive maintenance tasks:

```bash
# Manual generation
php artisan preventive:generate-work-orders

# Scheduled (runs daily at 6:00 AM)
# Set up cron job (Linux/macOS):
* * * * * cd /path/to/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for scheduler setup instructions.

---

## 📥 CSV Import

Quickly import your machine inventory:

1. Go to **Machines** → **Import Machines**
2. Download the CSV template
3. Fill in your machine data
4. Upload and preview
5. Confirm import

**Supported Fields**: name, code, location, manufacturer, model, serial_number, installation_date, criticality

## 🌍 Deployment

### Quick Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Set up server (PHP 8.2+, Composer, Node.js)
2. ✅ Clone repository and install dependencies
3. ✅ Configure `.env` file
4. ✅ Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. ✅ Build assets: `npm run build`

### Troubleshooting

**Can't log in?**
- Check your credentials (case-sensitive)
- Clear browser cache
- Verify `.env` configuration

**Tests failing?**
- Run `php artisan config:clear`
- Recreate test database
- Check PHP version (8.2+ required)

**Preventive tasks not generating work orders?**
- Check cron job is running: `php artisan schedule:list`
- Manually trigger: `php artisan preventive:generate-work-orders`
- Verify tasks are marked as "active"
