  - Fields: company_id, machine_id, title, description, schedule_interval_value (number), schedule_interval_unit (days/weeks/months), assigned_to, next_due_date, last_completed_at, is_active, created_at, updated_at

**Scheduling Logic:**
- [x] Time-based interval storage:
  - Store interval value (e.g., 3) and unit (e.g., months)
  - Calculate next_due_date = last_completed_at + interval (or created_at if never completed)
- [x] Daily scheduled job (Laravel command):
  - Find all active PreventiveTasks where next_due_date <= today + 3 days
  - For each task, check if WorkOrder already exists for this due date (prevent duplicates)
  - Create WorkOrder with type=preventive, status=open, preventive_task_id=task.id
  - Set WorkOrder.assigned_to from task.assigned_to
- [x] When WorkOrder (linked to PreventiveTask) is completed:
  - Update PreventiveTask.last_completed_at = WorkOrder.completed_at
  - Recalculate PreventiveTask.next_due_date = last_completed_at + interval
- [x] Handle edge cases:
  - If WorkOrder is cancelled: don't update last_completed_at
  - If task schedule is changed: recalculate next_due_date immediately
  - If machine is archived: set task.is_active = false

**API Endpoints:**
- [x] GET `/api/preventive-tasks` - List preventive tasks
  - Query params: machine_id, is_active, overdue
  - Output: list with machine name, next due date, overdue flag
- [x] POST `/api/preventive-tasks` - Create task (manager)
  - Input: machine_id, title, description, schedule_interval_value, schedule_interval_unit, assigned_to
  - Output: created task with calculated next_due_date
- [x] GET `/api/preventive-tasks/{id}` - Get task detail
  - Output: task with machine, generated work orders, completion history
- [x] PUT `/api/preventive-tasks/{id}` - Update task (manager)
  - Input: title, description, schedule, assigned_to, is_active
  - Recalculate next_due_date if schedule changed
- [x] DELETE `/api/preventive-tasks/{id}` - Deactivate task (manager)

**Frontend Screens:**
- [x] Preventive task list page (manager) (`resources/js/pages/preventive-tasks/index.tsx`)
  - Table with machine, task title, interval, next due date
  - Badge for overdue tasks (next_due_date < today)
  - Filter: show active/inactive, filter by machine
  - "Add Task" button
- [x] Add/edit preventive task form (`resources/js/pages/preventive-tasks/create.tsx`)
  - Machine dropdown (required)
  - Task title and description
  - Schedule inputs: interval value (number) + unit (dropdown: days/weeks/months)
  - Assign to technician (dropdown)

## Getting Started

1. Review this implementation plan
2. Set up development environment (Laravel + database)
3. Start with **Phase 1, Task 1.1** (Database models)
4. Work sequentially through each phase
5. Test thoroughly after each section
6. Update checkboxes as tasks are completed

**Recommended Order:**
1. Models & migrations → API endpoints → Frontend screens
